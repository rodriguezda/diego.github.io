# Tools

These are the tools we're going to need on a daily basis.

## [Slack](https://q3ectechdata2020.slack.com/)
Our class Slack! This is how we communicate and keep in touch. The `#pyt-825` channel is for posting questions and the `#pyt-825-resources` channel is where Juliann and Diego will post learning resources for the class.

## [Zoom](https://zoom.us/download)
Zoom is the video conferencing tool we will use. It works a lot like Google Hangouts or Skype. You will need to create an account in order to join the call. We will be using the following link and details for class: https://generalassembly.zoom.us/j/94582025074?pwd=R1RWT2JNRFZvbzd2bmJLaTVpaTVSdz09

Meeting ID: 945 8202 5074
Passcode: 711918

## [Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/welcome.ipynb)
You can install Jupyter Notebooks locally, BUT instead we will leverage a Google project called **Colaboratory**, or **Colab** for short. It has a pre-set up environment for Jupyter notebook which runs entirely on cloud (my laptop is very grateful üêå). Open the link above and sign in to your Google account. 

## [Jupyter Notebook/Jupyter Lab](https://jupyter.org/)
Jupyter Notebook is an open source web application that allows us to run "live" python code in "code" blocks and add explanatory text around it, describing the code and our methods.

In data science, this is of paramount importance because we are using code to tell a story - one that interprets a set of data and offers insight and/or conclusions.

----------------

# Extras!
Below are some bonus tools. We won't explicitly review or utilize them during this course, but they are very useful for all types of programming.

## Sublime Text
[Sublime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com/3) ‚Äî code editor ‚Äî you'll be writing code here. This is a free tool, but they will ask you to donate every few saves. However, you can use the program for free as long as you'd like.

-----------------

# Practice Problem Access
A folder containing blank copies of all practice problem sets is [in Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1iNcN0QfuPIYPN-xVTMxZPmaBKr07_JxD?usp=sharing).

**Please make a copy of the whole folder and save it to your Drive.**

Please append your name to the name of the folder (e.g. `PYTH825_JohnSmith`). Please share your copy of the folder (with edit access) with your Instructor and your IA.

**This is where you will keep your answers to all the practice problems.**

## Standards of Progress
General Assembly measures student progress through frequent homework assignments and in-depth projects.
Students are graded on a pass/fail basis. To receive a passing grade, students must:
1. Receive a passing grade on 80% of all homework assignments. Homework is graded on the basis of
completion. To receive a passing grade on a homework assignment, students must complete 100% of the
minimum tasks specified in that assignment.
2. Maintain consistent attendance as outlined in the Attendance section below. A passing grade in attendance
will be given to students with no more absences than the amount allowed, which varies by program.
3. Receive a passing grade on all course projects and complete any assigned assessments as applicable.


## Attendance
Attendance is taken by teachers when class begins and ends. Any student who arrives to class more than 15 minutes late will be marked tardy, and any student who is not present 15 minutes prior to class ending will be marked early departure. Three late arrivals and/or early departures will constitute one absence. Students in part-time courses are permitted to miss up to three
excused class meetings. Students who miss more than the excused absence policies outlined below for the type of course they are taking may be withdrawn.

# Instructor Policies
- Come to class. 
- Camera on!
- Ask questions.
- Do classwork/homework.
- Try your best.
- Have fun.
